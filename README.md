## 🚀 Project Overview

Collaborative Dynamic NFTs is a next-generation Web3 platform that transforms static NFTs into living, breathing, AI-enhanced collaborative assets. The platform enables multi-role community collaboration, real-time evolution, and innovative staking mechanisms to create a truly interactive digital art ecosystem.
